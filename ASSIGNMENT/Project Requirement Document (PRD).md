# 1. Introduction & Overview

## 1.1 Problem Statement
Gamers struggle to find a single, user-friendly platform where they can browse video games, consoles, and accessories, compare across platforms, and make quick purchases. Existing e-commerce sites are either too broad (general online stores) or lack intelligent recommendations.  
Also, our e-commerce website will provide unique statistical data for each game to boost customer satisfaction.

**How the Application should function:**

## 1.2 Proposed Solution
**BitByBit** is an e-commerce application dedicated to gamers. It allows users to:

- Browse games, consoles, and accessories.
- Search by platform (e.g., PlayStation, Nintendo Switch).
- Add products to a cart with instant pop-out preview.
- Checkout after logging in or registering.
- Use a smart chatbot (powered by **LangChain + RAWG API**) for personalized recommendations, live player stats, and ratings.

### Application Design

## 1.3 Target Audience
- **Primary:** Casual and hardcore gamers (ages 15–35) looking for an easy way to discover and buy games and consoles.
- **Secondary:** Parents or gift buyers seeking games or accessories with minimal effort.

- Will payment processing be handled internally or through an external service (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)?
- Should the chatbot provide customer support (order tracking) in addition to game recommendations?
