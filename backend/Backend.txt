Backend Tech Stack ⚙️
This backend is built using the Django framework on Python. It's designed to be a robust, scalable, and intelligent service that provides a powerful API, secure authentication, and advanced AI capabilities.

Core Framework
Python: A versatile and powerful programming language that is the foundation of our backend.

Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

Database
MongoDB: A NoSQL, document-oriented database used as our primary data store. It offers flexibility and scalability, which is ideal for handling complex and unstructured data.

If we need for ease but not a confirmed component yet, PyMongo: The underlying Python driver that Djongo uses to communicate with the MongoDB database.

API & Routing
Django REST Framework (DRF): A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. RESTful APIs.

Authentication & Authorization 🔐
It is easy to use JWT (JSON Web Token): A JSON Web Token based authentication plugin for the Django REST Framework. It provides a secure, stateless method for authenticating users and protecting API routes using access and refresh tokens.

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning 🧠
This stack includes libraries for integrating AI-powered features directly into the application. Long-running AI tasks are handled asynchronously to ensure the API remains fast and responsive.

ML/AI Libraries:

TensorFlow / PyTorch: For building and serving deep learning models, including neural networks for computer vision or natural language processing.

Deployment & Environment
Nginx: A high-performance web server used as a reverse proxy in front of Gunicorn to handle incoming traffic, serve static files, and manage security.
